# Time-Evolution-QC-Project
 Time evolution of the Hamiltonian H = − X L i=1 (Xi ⊗ Xi+1 + Yi ⊗ Yi+1 + JzZi ⊗ Zi+1). Two cases Jz > 1 and Jz &lt; −1 are considered. The Jz > 1 initial states tested are |0⟩ ⊗L and |1⟩ ⊗L. The Jz &lt; −1 state is  |10⟩ ⊗L/2. The lattice sites are rotated and the X, Y, Z are measured over time.
